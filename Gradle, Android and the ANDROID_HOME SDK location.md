#Gradle, Android and the ANDROID_HOME SDK location

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19794200/gradle-android-and-the-android-home-sdk-location/34272936


 
I've created a file called local.properties and put inside
sdk.dir=/my_current_way_to/sdk

Or:

in the console I need to do

set ANDROID_HOME=/my_current_way_to/sdk
